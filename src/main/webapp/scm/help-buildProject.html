The ClearCase UCM Plugin offers the option to have an extra ClearCase project to host all the streams needed to build. This is done to avoid a lot of irrelevant streams in the integration-stream. 
Please make an extra project for this purpose and enter the name here. If you don't enter anything, the ClearCase UCM Plugin will assume you have a project called "hudson", "Hudson", "jenkins" or "Jenkins". 
If you don't have this extra build-project, the auxiliary stream will be placed in your integration project for every new job.
If you wish to change or set the build-project, then you need to make a new job in Hudson/Jenkins, otherwise the already made stream will be used.
